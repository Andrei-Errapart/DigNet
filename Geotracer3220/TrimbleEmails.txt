Hello Andrei Errapart

Please find enclosed the CU plus program. This you can run on any PC, it is the same as on the Norand ACU that Geotronics once deceived.

Connect to Com port 1 on the Geotracer.
In order to communicate with the receiver it need to be tracking satellites.

Check the Geotracer Options from main Menu, arrow down to page 5.

Do not rush the button pressing.
The F2 (PARA) should be background lit before you press the button, once the parameters are set you can save them with F2.

You use Function buttons and the page up and down as well as the arrow keys (up down, right and left) to set parameters.

The documentation is including instructions for CU Plus in chapter 13 part 2.

Hope this helps

Best regards

Hello  Mr. Andrei

1. Pin out as attached drawing for cable (röd = red, Vit = White, Gul = Yellow, Sv = Black.
12 -> 4 pin: 2->1, 3->2, 9->3, 5->4.

2. Reset is done through connecting the Hiroze 12 pin to Hiroze 4 pin cable ( 571 208 030) between the ports 1 and 4, then switching on power, this resets the receiver to factory default.
Com 3 will the (by default) transmit radio data in Geotracer format, this is probably what you have seen. 

The main led should preferably just light Green steady
Yellow equals no Sat's, flashing green = 1 to 3 sats steady green 4 or more sats.

Hope this helps
Best regards
